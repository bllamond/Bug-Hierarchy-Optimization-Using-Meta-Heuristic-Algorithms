# Bug Hierarchy Optimization Using Meta-Heuristic Algorithms

## Key Features
- **Genetic Algorithms (GA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for feature selection.
- **Scalable Solution: Efficiently handles large datasets and complex bug hierarchies.
- **Visualization: Visual insights into the optimization process.


This bug prioritization system automates the bug triage process, optimizing software development efficiency. The combination of NLP, PSO, and GA provides a robust and scalable solution for bug management. The proposed approach has shown superior performance compared to traditional methods like SVM, Decision Trees, and Random Forest.
